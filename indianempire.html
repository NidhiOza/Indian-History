			<p style="color:#800000;font-size:20px;">In its time, the Maurya Empire was one of the largest empires of
				the world. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the
				Himalayas, to the east into Assam, to the west into Balochistan (southwest Pakistan and southeast Iran) 
				and into the Hindu Kush mountains of what is now Afghanistan. The Empire was expanded into India’s central
				and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and Bindusara, but it excluded a small portion of unexplored
				tribal and forested regions near Kalinga (modern Odisha), until it was conquered by Ashoka. It declined
				for about 50 years after Ashoka’s rule ended, and it dissolved in 185 BCE with the foundation of the Shunga
				Dynasty in Magadha.

					<p style="color:#800000;font-size:20px;">The Mughal, Mogul or Moghul Empire, was an early modern empire 
						in South Asia. For some two centuries, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in
						the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day
						Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in south India.

						of the Indian subcontinent in the 18th century. The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as the 
						Chhatrapati and ended in 1818 with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II at the hands of the British East India Company. The Marathas 
						are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal Rule over most of the Indian subcontinent.

					Some traces remain of the presence of the Kushans in the area of Bactria and Sogdiana in the 2nd-1st
					century BC, where they had displaced the Sakas, who moved further south.Archaeological structures are
					known in Takht-i Sangin, Surkh Kotal (a monumental temple), and in the palace of Khalchayan. On the
					ruins of ancient Hellenistic cities such as Ai-Khanoum, the Kushans are known to have built fortresses.
					Various sculptures and friezes from this period are known, representing horse-riding archers,and,
					significantly, men such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan with artificially deformed skulls, a practice
					well attested in nomadic Central Asia.Some of the Khalchayan sculptural scenes are also thought to depict
					the Kushans fighting against the Sakas.In these portrayals, the Yuezhis are shown with a majestic 
					demeanour, whereas the Sakas are typically represented with side-wiskers, and more or less grotesque
					facial expressions.
