					religious group. It traces its spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four 
					leaders or Tirthankaras, with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the 
					tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago; the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha,
					whom historians date to 9th century BCE; and the twenty-fourth tirthankara, Mahavira around 600
					BCE. Jainism is considered to be an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle
					of the cosmology.</p>
